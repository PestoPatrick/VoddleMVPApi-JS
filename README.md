# VoddleMVPApi-JS

The backend api for Voddle written in Javascript using Express for the routing and Postgresql as the database. Might use Redis for handling JWT tokens but that won't
be in the mvp version of the site. switched to javascript as c# was taking too long to learn and build the site without help. I am familiar with c# now and want to get
Voddle completed as it has taken too long as it is.
